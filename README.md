A tool for drawing with links.

For now I am building it in the worst possible way to make it instantly useful to myself, with the idea of expanding it, if it sticks.

This is what I am imagining.

- Drawings
		- Drawing page
  - My drawings
	- Timely drawings
		- Daily drawings
		- Weekly drawings
	- Tag drawings
	- Automatic drawings
- Account
  - Signup/Log in/Log out/Edit account
	- Connect Pinboard
		- Sync
	- Download my information

The drawings can be shared as an image or linked to so they are clickable and forkable.

In the future you can also use drawing to perform batch actions, like adding and removing tags, exporting to an are.na collection.

Draw with friends in realtime.

Edit and copy drawings.

Copy between drawings.

Display tweets.

Pull in images.
